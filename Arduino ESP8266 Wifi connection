Topic: Interfacing ESP8266 Wi-Fi module with Arduino UNO

Objective:

For end-point IoT developments, ESP8266 wifi module, a low cost standalone wireless transceiver, is used. It provides embedded applications access to the internet using TCP/UDP communication protocol. 
The microcontroller uses set of AT commands to communicate with the ESP8266 wifi module through UART with specified Baud rate (Default 115200).

From Arduino IDE, click on the path: File -> Preference-> Additional Board Manager urls
Add the following url:
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

Port connected to esp8266 needs to be selected.

Go to "Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager", type "ESP8266" and install it.
Go again to "Tools -> Board" and select "Generic ESP8266 Module".

Hardware Required: Arduino Uno, Arduino IDE, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, Wiring, Breadboard, USB cable

Connect these wires:
•	TX on the ESP8266 connected to TX on the Arduino Uno.
•	RX on the ESP8266 connected to RX on the Arduino Uno.
•	EN on the ESP8266 connected to 3.3V on the Arduino Uno
•	3v3 (or VCC) on the ESP8266 connected to 3.3V on the Arduino Uno.
•	GND on the ESP8266 connected to GND on the Arduino Uno.

With these wires connections, commands are passed from Arduino Uno Serial monitor present in  Arduino IDE to the ESP8266 via. 

Code: Arduino to ESP8266 wifi module connection

Conclusion:
We are using the Arduino to communicate with the ESP8266, which means we’ll be making use of the transmitting and receiving pins to communicate with the Arduino Wi-Fi module.
