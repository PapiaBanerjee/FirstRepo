Topic:  Arduino UNO – External pin setup – Fading of external LED on breadboard.

Objective: Using an Arduino UNO board to see physical output: it fades the light of a glowing external LED.

Hardware Required: 1 × Breadboard, 1 × Arduino Uno R3, 1 × LED, 1 × 330Ω Resistor, 2 × Jumper, 

Circuit Diagram: CD2a, CD2b

Led_Builtin pin  is connected to an external LED. Build the circuit as CD2a.png and CD2b.png to lit an external LED. 
Connect digital pin of LED_BUILTIN constant to one end of the resistor. 
Connect other end of the resistor to the long leg or positive leg or anode of the LED.
Connect the short leg or negative leg or cathode of the LED to the GND. D13 is set as the LED_BUILTIN value. 
The resistor in series with the LED may have values other than 220 ohms. The LED glows with up to 1K ohms.
After the circuit is built, the Arduino board is plugged to computer and the Arduino Software (IDE) is started. 

Code: Arduino Fading of external LED.png
Code as given.
First initialize LED_BUILTIN pin as an output pin:
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
pinMode(13, OUTPUT) − The built-in “function” pinMode() tell Arduino Uno whether a pin is an INPUT or OUTPUT.
AnalogWrite(13, brightness) −Set the brightness value of the OUTPUT pin using AnalogWrite() function.

Conclusion:
We should see our LED light fade its brightness from 255 to 0. 
By varying the variable ‘fadeAmount’ in the code, we can control the fading of brightness of the external LED connected with the Arduino.
